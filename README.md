# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview

This project consisted of three main phases. In the first phase, we used the numpy 'random' function to generate a random set of longitudes and lattitudes. We then used Citipy to find the nearest city to each of these coordinates. Then we, used the Open Weather Map API to get weather information for each of the cities. Next, we used the Google Directions API to find Hotels in each of the cities, and to create a map that displayed all the cities and their corresponding information. Finally we created a map layered with Google maps directions for a proposed vacation.
